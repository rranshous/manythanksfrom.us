how do we want the process to feel?
- easy
- fast
- customizable ? -- thought tied to the customizing of
                    templates for the product

be like?
- go to website and it has blurb about what it is
  what it can do
- picture of what the products might look like
- not too many links
- choose from some preset / generic wordings
  with some madlibs boxes
- or complete blank you can decorate with your
  own pictures or free clip art
- be able to send it to myself so that i don't have
  to give you all the email addresses
- secure / easy way of knowing the emails went out fine
- confirmations make me feel happy (fast)
- refrences to poetry or w/e, bank of occasions / themes

i like the idea of craigslist style email links

one email per event


================================================


blub + media of gift / happyness / w/e

public / listed, or private (obscicated)

periodic reminder emails -- "have you updated your thank you list"

"how many gifts do you expect to receive?"

"you expected to get 50 by yesterday you only registered 12 .."

if gifts is the same thing as givers than it is .. equal in # ..
maybe u don't want to track the presents and not the people ..
u've cast a wider net

broadcasting on twitter / FB

option to input list of people ahead of time
 track % gifts sent thank you's against people list

"would you like to include a *sender list" -- yes ->
lets you input the names ahead of time -- optional step

event end date -- timeout free accounts

premium features ?
 printed cards cheaper
  maybe embossed envelopes for free ?
 1 yr retention
 log their info abt previous gift senders to guess new lists
 can pull up old invite lists even if the pages have expired
 more blurb templates
 premium templates for published pages
 
printed cards -- rate covering our cost + some for non-paying
 -- paying customers get it @ our time

templates for blurbs -- paying customers get more templates

templates for pages, paying get more options

pay for custom designs / logos  / monograms ?

ability to add other users to an acct -- premium

word bank of typical gift names / adjectives -- premium ?

bulk fill in ? -- name, email, blurb, picture -- not worth it initially

be able to apply categories / tags and than fill out templates
for all items in the set at once
"deal <name> thank you for the camping gear ..."
